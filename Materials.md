# Materials
RF and Antenna engineering often requires the material properties of many things including PCBs, die attach (adhesives), lenses, Radomes and more. 

## PCB Material Comparison 
Each mfg publishes their own data, but it is often hard to compare across manufacturers. 
[APCT Material Comparison Chart](https://www.apct.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Material-Comparison-11x17_September-2020.pdf) - This chart compares every relevant spec for over 65 PCB materials 

## Terahertz Material Characterization
5G and soon to be 6G are all the rage, but information on materials above 100GHz can be rare. 

[Michigan State THz Characterized Materials](https://www.egr.msu.edu/emrg/thz-characterized-materials) - Rogers, HDPE, PTFE and more up to 1.6THz

[Miscellaneous Data on Materials for Millimetre and Submillimetre Optics](http://www.terahertz.co.uk/images/data/Miscellaneous%20Data%20On%20Materials%20For%20Millimetre%20And%20Submillimetre%20Optics-2.PDF) - This paper was published 25 years ago, but still contains THz material characterizations that have gone unrepeated to this day
